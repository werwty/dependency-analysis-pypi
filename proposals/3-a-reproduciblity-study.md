## A Reproducibility Study

### Faulds: A Non-Parametric Iterative Classifier for Internet-Wide OS Fingerprinting

For all the reasons discussed in class Faulds is a good candidate for a reproduciblity study. 
Given their assumed 50% packet loss rate just isn't reasonable, we can measure how Faulds and Hershel+ does in a resonable setting.

We can fix the methodology and see if the results are comparable to what the Princeton students found in 2015.
