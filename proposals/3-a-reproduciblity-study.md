## A Reproducibility Study

Reproducibility is the backbone of science! We found 2 previously published papers with questionable results that would benefit from a reproducibility study. 

### Faulds: A Non-Parametric Iterative Classifier for Internet-Wide OS Fingerprinting

For all the reasons discussed in class Faulds is a good candidate for a reproducibility study. 
Given their assumed 50% packet loss rate just isn't reasonable, we can measure how Faulds and Hershel+ does in a reasonable setting.

We would:

1. Reproduce the Faulds study with the parameters used in their paper
2. See if Faulds is still useful given reasonable parameters.
3. Do the same for Hershel+ and use that to compare against the Faulds results. 


### An empirical study of Namecoin and lessons for decentralized namespace design

https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~arvindn/publications/namespaces.pdf

The researchers found that there were only 28 domains registered with namecoin and used. 

The Namecoin developers claim that this study only produced such results because of faulty methodology design.

We can analyze and update the methodology and see if the results are comparable to what the Princeton researchers found in 2015.
